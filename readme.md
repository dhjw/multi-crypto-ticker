#### or

- Load unpacked extension
- Choose multi-crypto-ticker folder

### Usage
- Click icon to change displayed coin
- Hover over icon to view all enabled coin prices
- Right click icon to access options (customize coins, update frequency and icon badge background color)

### API Limits
All prices are obtained via the CoinMarketCap API. As of late 2018 a [free API key](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/) is required. The request limit on the free Basic plan is 333/day, so it is recommended to get a separate API key for each computer that stays online with the browser open to allow updating prices every 5 minutes. Alternately, for two computers you can set the update frequency to every 10 minutes, or on three computers every 15 minutes, to stay within the Basic plan limits using a single API key.
